## Milestone Progress

* Exploratory data analysis
  - [x] Plot histograms for the following numeric columns: Price, Latitude &

* Dealing with missing values, outliers
  - [x] Find out the number of missing values in each variable.
  - [x] Find out the number of outliers in each variable. Plot visualisations to
demonstrate them. Handle outliers.
  - [x] Can we safely drop the missing values? If not, how will you deal with them?
  
* Feature extraction from images and text
  - [x] Extract features from the images and transform it into data that’s ready to be
used in the model for classification.
  - [x] Extract features from the text data and transform it into data that’s ready to be
used in the model for classification.
